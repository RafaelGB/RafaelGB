Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I am a backend developer with expertise in both Python and Java. With years of experience in building robust and scalable backend systems, I have a strong foundation in a variety of technologies and methodologies. In addition to my backend capabilities, I also have an interest in front end development and am always looking for ways to expand my skillset.

One area that particularly excites me is personal knowledge management and the creation of tools to help individuals better organize, understand, and make use of their own information. I believe that having a strong system for managing our own knowledge is essential for personal growth and productivity.
